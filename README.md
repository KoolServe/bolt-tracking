Tracking
---

Configure all of the tracking scripts required for your website. Many tracking providers set very low cache expiry headers causing your Google page speed score to suffer as a result. With this extension installed you will not be affected by this as the scripts are proxied via Bolt and reasonable caching headers are set.

## Supported providers
 - [Google Analytics](https://www.google.co.uk/analytics)
 - (More to be added soon)
